## About Me

Thank you for visiting my page. I am Chen Hao (ÈôàÊòä).  Currently I am a first-year Ph.D student in HKUST(GZ), supervised by Dr. Yeyu Tong.
 
- üëâ **2021.3 ~ 2022.6** I worked as a software engineer at ByteDance Inc. maintaining the data warehouse platform in data centers.

- üëâ **2018.9 ~ 2021.6** I was a master student at South China University of Technology(SCUT) supervised by Prof. Jian Zhao, where my works mainly focus on the short-reach optical interconnect and digital signal processing.

- üëâ **2018.6 ~ 2021.9** I was a research intern at Guangdong Semiconductor Research Institute, researching the IC design (SAR-ADC and eualization algorithm design) for the high-speed PAM4 optical transceiver.  

- üëâ **2014.9 ~ 2018.6** I was a undergraduate student at South China University of Technology(SCUT). I was the leader of national innovation project for undergraduate student researching the indoor optical wireless positioning system.
